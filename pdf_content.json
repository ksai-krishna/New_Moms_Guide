Adjust antihypertensive therapy: Increase Lisinopril to 40mg daily. Monitor \nblood pressure bi-weekly. \n2. Continue Atorvastatin 40mg but reassess lipid levels in 6-8 weeks. Consider \nadding Ezetimibe if LDL levels remain high. \n3. Order stress test and echocardiogram to further evaluate for underlying \ncoronary artery disease or heart failure. \n4. Lifestyle modi\ufb01cations: \no Encourage a heart-healthy diet (Mediterranean diet recommended). \no Increase daily physical activity with gradual introduction of light aerobic \nexercise. \no Counseling for weight loss with a target of 10% reduction over the next 6 \nmonths. \n5. Follow-up: In 4 weeks for stress test results and reevaluation of hypertension. \n \nPhysician: Dr. Emily White, MD \nSignature: _________________________ \nDate: 09/23/2024 \n "
